 * Index of `ssid` within the last scan, or -1.
 *
 * Matching is CASE-INSENSITIVE by deliberate choice. 802.11 SSIDs are opaque
 * byte strings and are technically case-sensitive, so an exact-match scan
 * lookup is "correct" -- and it cost us a debugging session: the iPhone
 * hotspot broadcasts "RY-OPS" while iOS displays the device name as "ry-ops".
 * Apple upper-cases the beacon SSID; the UI does not. An exact match therefore
 * reports "not in scan" for a network sitting at -24 dBm.
 *
 * Case-folding here only affects which scan entry we *select*. The passphrase
 * is unchanged, and WiFi.begin() is handed the SSID exactly as the AP
 * broadcasts it (WiFi.SSID(idx)), not as the user typed it -- so the
 * association itself remains byte-exact.
